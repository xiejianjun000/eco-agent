> A curated list of plugins for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`).

DeepSeek Harness is DeepSeek's open-source agent harness — a runnable coding agent (Web and headless), built on a framework where everything is a plugin: models, tools, sandboxes, session storage, UI, even the agent loop itself. Plugins can extend the official coding agent, swap out its core parts, or assemble something entirely different.
